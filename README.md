# Atom Proxy

A new webproxy I made for the titaniumnetwork proxython.

## Setup

Use pnpm to install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
pnpm build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
pnpm run preview
```

## Public Preview

I am working on it, it will be made available at https://atom.onlycs.net/
