## About Atom

Atom is a web proxy service. It provides a way to access the web anonymously and offers a 
number of features to enhance your privacy on the internet. We aim to end internet censorship
in schools and workplaces by providing ways to bypass content filters. Here's some features
we use to achieve this:

## Features

1. **User-friendly Interface**    
	- Atom is designed to be as easy to use as possible. It's as simple as entering a URL and
	  pressing enter. No need to worry about complicated settings or configurations, though
	  they exist if you want them.

2. **Encrypted Connections**
	- All connections to Atom are encrypted using SSL. This means that no one can see what
	  you're doing on the internet, not even your ISP.

3. **Bypass Content Filters**
	- Using the open-source proxying APIs, [Ultraviolet](https://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/Ultraviolet)
	  and [Bare](https://github.com/tomphttp/bare-server-node), we are able to provide an efficient
	  and reliable way to bypass content filters. You will be able to access websites blocked by your
	  school or workplace.

4. **No Logs**
	- To protect your privacy, we do not keep logs on activity performed through Atom's proxying service.
	  This means that no one can see what you're doing on the internet, not even us.

5. **No Ads**
	- Atom is completely free to use and is supported by donations. We do not show ads on our website
	  or in the proxying service.
